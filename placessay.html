                <p>
                    At the tender age of 12, I knew a few things with absolute certainty: I was born in Malaysia, I have two sisters and my favourite number is three. 
                </p><p>
                    The last fact baffled my parents, for I was known to be frustratingly indecisive. Favourite colour? Don’t know. Favourite food? Don’t know. Favourite numbe— three. Always three.
                </p><p>
                    Naturally, they asked, why? I’d puff out my nonexistent chest, beam giddily and proudly list the three reasons (obviously):
                    <ol>
                        <li>I was the third daughter.
                        <li>Our Singapore apartment was on the third floor.
                        <li>Our shop lot house in Johor Bahru, affectionately called <i>san-lou</i> (or ‘third-floor’), was also on the third level.
                    </ol>
                </p><p>
                    My parents bought <i>san-lou</i> two years after we moved to Singapore, when I just turned seven. The first time we visited, it was a Saturday, and instead of sleeping in, my sisters and I were bundled into our seven-seater at the crack of dawn, eyes drooping shut as our father whizzed us across the Causeway. 
                </p><p>
                    I blinked awake to a row of shophouses. Not the charming, colourful ones tourists adored but the kind you'd find anywhere in Malaysia — crumbling pasty columns, spindles of black climbing up the corners and slitted drain covers where nightmarish sludge peeked through. Our parents led us across the metal tables of the mamak restaurant, past the jarring lights of a 7-eleven sign, to a nondescript grey gate, its paint peeling off in chunks. The three of us stood exhausted and unimpressed, as they fumbled with the lock. “Ta-da,” they announced, the gate creaking open. “This is <i>san-lou</i>.”
                </p><p>
                    Beyond the gate lay cement stairs, foreboding under dim light. We trudged up, one by one, our steps echoing off the walls that closed in on both sides. At the landing between the second and third floors, another weathered gate awaited, which I remember thinking was so odd. Some trips after, I would pretend it was a portal to another dimension.
                </p><p>
                    And just like a mysterious portal, my memory gets hazy after that point. I’ve asked around, requested pictures, but I simply cannot recall the interior of <i>san-lou</i>. What I do remember is this: we’d return to <i>san-lou</i> every few months, my sisters and I bickering over the chores the moment we arrived (we all wanted to change the sheets). Each time we returned, the air would be musty from having been enclosed too long. And when you mopped the floor, the gloss of the black-and-white chequered tiles outshone even the glistening wet tracks under the fluorescent lights.
                </p><p>
                    **
                </p><p>
                    One morning, I awoke to our car pulling into my grandma’s house. As we unloaded our things, I asked my mother, “are we not going to <i>san-lou</i> first?”
                </p><p>
                    “No, we rented <i>san-lou</i> out. We’ll stay with popo from now on.”
                </p><p>
                    “Oh. Okay.”
                </p><p>
                    You never really grasp the significance of a moment until it’s over. Sometimes, it comes only a decade later, while writing an essay about the place that you consider your first Malaysia home. At some point in our many journeys to Malaysia, we found ourselves returning to grandma’s house or my aunt’s apartment—never our place. 
                </p><p>
                    My sisters and I never talked about it, but I have an inkling they felt the same. Over the years, our trips to Malaysia dwindled from five to four, then to three, and sometimes just two. We were busy, we said, but the truth is much harsher, and rather simple. We stopped going because Malaysia wasn’t home anymore, just where our relatives lived. 
                </p><p>
                    **
                </p><p>
                    Years later, my parents bought another apartment in Malaysia, this time on the 30th floor. We were all there to tidy up, and as my sisters and I peered at the rising elevator numbers, my eldest remarked, “Look at us, from <i>san-lou</i> to <i>san-shi lou</i> (or ‘thirtieth-floor’).” 
                </p><p>
                    I snickered. “What an upgrade, huh.”        
                </p><p>
                    My other sister said, “I’m taking the sheets.”  
                </p><p>
                    “Oh, come on.”
                </p><p>
                    It felt like old times. We swept the floor, wiped the windows, and at the end of the day, sat down on cream tiles and drank beer instead of teh-c, because we were all older now. I looked around at the five of us crammed in a living room that seemed like an echo from the past and realised, ah, this was what I lost.
                </p><p>
                    They say home is not a place, but I disagree. The day we rented out <i>san-lou</i>, I had lost a physical connection to my roots. All I have left are the fuzzy memories of a time when things were black and white, and what is that compared to the one who returns to it at every end of the day, painstakingly cleans the dust off its windows, and who has a concrete place they could truly call their own?
                </p><p>   
                    At 22, I know a few more things. I was born in Malaysia, but it has no place for me anymore. I have two sisters, one of whom I see every other weekend. And three is no longer my favourite number.
