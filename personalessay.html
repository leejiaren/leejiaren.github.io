                <p>
                    My first year of college, a friend from class caught a glimpse of my stomach and remarked, “You have such a tiny waist.” For an instant, I considered
                    saying, “Well, I don’t eat,” just to see her envy twist into something closer to pity and horror. Because a girl is
                    most beautiful when she is thin, but sick in the head if she starves herself to get there. But it would be cruel to
                    say that to someone who meant well, so I simply smiled and thanked her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been slender, thin, underweight—never fat. There was the occasional cooing over my pillowy cheeks, but
                    generally, I was the ideal weight for girls my age. By all accounts, I had no reason to feel insecure. Perhaps
                    that’s why it took me so long to realize I was teetering on the cusp of an eating disorder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me preface this by saying: my story is not unique. Eating disorders have surged worldwide during the pandemic, and in Singapore, 8% of young
                    people are at risk. Before everything went down, I had already seen multiple bony, anorexic girls on TV and
                    understood that it was wrong. Unnatural. I’d wondered, with morbid fascination, <i>how could they let it get this
                        far?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turns out, it’s easy. Skip one meal, then another, and sit back as the world applauds you—until they turn around and
                    shun you for the very thing they once praised. Which is why this story has to be said over and over again. It can
                    happen to anyone. It is happening with more and more people. It happened to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explain, I must begin with the mole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born with an average build, an unusually shy personality, and a mole on the right side of my nose. By eleven,
                    I had watched enough TV and celebrities to know that it wasn’t the pretty kind — it was inky, raised and large
                    enough to throw off the symmetry in my face. So I told my mother, “You know, according to the Tung Shu ,” I pointed
                    at the offending black bump, “this mole suggests a tendency to succumb to illness. I should get it removed.” She
                    regarded me over raised brows, then patted my head, “Maybe when you’re older.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dissatisfied, I took matters into my own hands. In the grimy bathroom of my primary school, I pressed a fingernail
                    against the mole and began to scrape at the black pigment. Slow at first, then with increasing force till my eyes
                    watered and there was nothing left but a raw, red crater. When I returned to the classroom in triumph, Julie, my
                    best friend, examined the wound festering in dried blood with mild disgust. “Why do you want to remove it?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I shrugged and picked at the scab again. It seemed obvious enough. Once the mole was gone, I would be pretty. Then,
                    maybe, I wouldn’t have to sit on the stairwell alone, watching everyone else chatter on easily. I could be someone
                    people actually enjoyed being around. Because, as everyone knows, when you’re pretty, anything you do is adorable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the mole returned to its former glory within days. I grumbled and moved on. 
                </p>
<br>
                <p>
                    Then I was fifteen, in my third year of secondary school, and we had just been assigned new classes. The girl next to me
                    had a round face, plump figure and slitted eyes that disappeared when her lips curled up. With one glance, I deemed her
                    plain. But came recess, and suddenly our table was surrounded, with people asking about her December break–<i>fine</i>–if she
                    finished her homework–<i>obviously not</i>, she scoffed. I marvelled as they giggled at every flick of her hair as if it were
                    the most amusing thing. I couldn't decide who I wanted to be: her or them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned her name was Shuning and her best friend was Alyssa, another girl in our class that was her equal in charm and
                    wit. We grew close, fast. The day a group chat was formed with the three of us in it, I was simultaneously ecstatic and
                    frightened. After all, any day now, they might just decide I didn’t measure up to their effortless humour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few days into our precarious friendship, they told me they were skipping lunch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why?” I asked, incredulous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Just…not hungry.” Shuning said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alyssa leaned in and whispered, “She has tea to spill.”  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plonked back into my seat immediately. They burst into laughter, and being the reason for their amusement was enough
                    to sustain me till the end of lunch. When the hunger pangs hit, I assured myself this was a one-time thing. Except, two
                    days later—
                </p>
                <p>
                    “—again?” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You can go if you like.” They laughed. “We’re used to it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “...No.” I grinned weakly. “I’m not that hungry.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Habits form in 21 days, but it only took a week for the hollow ache of my stomach to become routine. Sometimes, I balk
                    at how easy it was. But then I remember the eleven-year-old girl who dug a hole out of her face so people would like
                    her, and really, what’s a few skipped meals?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A month later, I caught my reflection and abruptly saw that the baby fat on my cheeks were gone. A friend had once said
                    my features were “too squeezed in the centre”. Now, I stared at the perfect balance of my features on my gaunt face and
                    thought, with awe, I’m pretty. Then it hit me: I had stopped eating, and now I was thinner. I couldn’t rip that mole off
                    my face, would never be half as charming as Shuning, but I could stop eating. It was an infallible plan: if I could
                    control my weight, then I could control the way people perceived me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I doubled down. An average woman needs 1800 calories a day — so I ate half or less. Skipping lunch was no longer enough.
                    Dinner became morsels that I’d measure against calorie charts before climbing the stairs of my condo to burn them off.
                    When my parents started asking questions, I would finish dinner before they came home, scrambling the rice pot so it
                    looked touched, even though I’d eaten nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life seemed to turn from then on. Compliments kept coming — about how slender I’ve become, how veiny my arms were, how
                    good my legs look in those jeans. All my clothes hung off my frame beautifully. I felt more accepted than ever.
                    Everywhere I looked, society offered its praise. Every gram I dropped, my belief was reinforced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strangely, the less I ate, the more anxious I became. As if I was terrified that someone might see past the illusion and
                    glimpse the same awkward girl. But I kept going, because it was the one thing I could control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few months later, I was skipping recess as usual while my friends headed out for a rare break. The classroom was
                    quiet, with only a few people lounging around. As I packed away my homework, a classmate approached and asked, “Can I
                    ask you something?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What?” I replied offhandedly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Are you anorexic?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    My vision tunnelled. The world spun even though I was still frozen in the blue plastic chair. My first thought was: wow,
                    these descriptions didn’t just exist in books. By the time I regained my senses and choked out a laugh, the atmosphere
                    had turned awkward. We turned to our desks and never spoke the entirety of recess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet those words haunted me for days. Strange, how hard it was to be called anorexic, for it is an easy label to put on
                    any of those bony girls; a label that convinces, that sticks, that explains everything from my protruding ribs to
                    angular knees. But when did I go from a “pretty” girl to the “anorexic” girl?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, I simply started eating my meals again. I didn’t see a doctor or tell anyone; I just began to slowly unravel
                    the habits ingrained in my life. I finished every meal down to the last grain, and watched my parents beam in approval.
                    Within a year, I returned to my original weight. Deep down though, I knew I hadn’t done it for myself. I had done it
                    because the thought of being seen as anorexic had become more unbearable than becoming unattractive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These days, I eat three meals a day. But no matter how much we mature, a part of us remains hostage to the childhoods we
                    had. Some days, it still feels like I’m fifteen, yearning for the approval of people I don’t care for. And the world
                    never seems to let me forget her. I see her in the friend embarking on a keto diet, in the bowl of rice that I know is
                    242 kilocalories and in the one who said, “You have such a tiny waist.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so I write. To the girl at fifteen trapped in a body of her own making, to all the girls finding their way out, and
                    to the ones that will grow up in a world that continues to scrutinize a woman for her shape, size, and moles. I write so
                    she knows — it’s okay, you can stop.
                </p>
