                    Love is a universal human experience, yet French literary theorist Roland Barthes argues that the language surrounding love is fundamentally problematic. Hence, in his work "A Lover's Discourse," Barthes seeks to illuminate this problem and offer a framework for lovers to navigate their emotional journey. This essay aims to dissect the language system established by Barthes in his quest for a coherent language of love and apply it to the analysis of the character Richard Papen in Donna Tartt's novel, “The Secret History.” Initially, it explores Richard’s romanticized depiction of Camilla through the lens of Barthes’ figures, revealing the complexities of the obsessive lover’s experience. Subsequently, by reimagining Richard as a lover consumed by an aesthetic obsession, it delves into the dangers of the isolated lover, a concern at the heart of Barthes' inquiry.
                </p><p>
                    Barthes’s A Lover’s Discourse identifies the problematic as the isolation of the lover, which he identified in the following claim: “the necessity of this book…is that the lover's discourse is today of an extreme solitude” (Barthes 2). For Barthes, the lover is isolated because “there is no system of love: and the several systems which surround the contemporary lover offer him no room (except for an extremely devaluated place)” (Barthes 211). Contemporary systems of thought, be they religious, psychological, or philosophical, fail to provide adequate space for the lover's experience. Instead, they encourage the lover “to reduce the great imaginary current, the orderless, endless stream which is passing through him, to a painful, morbid crisis of which he must be cured, which he must "get over"” (Barthes 7). In other words, the intensity of love one feels in the throes of romance is often perceived as a threat to society – disruptive and dangerous. Therefore, despite love being a universal experience, individuals find themselves grappling with its complexities alone due to the absence of a comprehensive language system to express and understand it. In this void Barthes contends that all discourse in love is derived from the one who loves, who has to consistently affirm its existence. Thus, Barthes presents the lover’s discourse not as an exchange of romantic sentiments, but rather an intimate dialogue the lover holds within themselves. 
                </p><p>
                    Barthes presents this “portrait” of the lover with three key elements: figures, order and references. The book is split into fragments, each labeled as figures. He calls for readers to understand it “in its gymnastic or choreographic acceptation” (Barthes 3), suggesting that it captures a moment or gesture of the lover in action. They take the shape of signs or symbols that are conventionally associated with love. Barthes, however, emphasizes that beneath each figure lies an element of "verbal hallucination”, where language becomes distorted or insufficient, limited by its “syntactical portion” (Barthes 6). For instance, the fragment “Adorable!” finds the lover working through the word, only to realize it cannot express what it loves about the person. The passage “Adorable means: this is my desire, insofar as it is unique…Yet the more I experience the specialty of my desire, the less I can give it a name” epitomizes the difficulty of understanding and expressing the full depths of the lover’s sentiment within reductive language systems (Barthes 20). To this conundrum, Barthes says that “each of us can fill in this code according to his own history”, which essentially encourages readers to rely upon and accept differences when translating the meaning of each figure to their own lives (Barthes 5). The idea of differential love experience is further emphasized by the lack of order among the host of figures. Barthes makes it abundantly clear that the figures are “non-syntagmatic, non-narrative” (Barthes 7), even goes as far to subjugate the series of figures by order of the alphabet, in order to make clear that it was an “absolutely insignificant order” (Barthes 8). The importance of the non-order is this: “I believe…that the amorous phenomenon is an "episode" endowed with a beginning…and an end…Yet the initial scene during which I was ravished is merely reconstituted: it is after the fact. I reconstruct a traumatic image which I experience in the present but which I conjugate (which I speak) in the past.” (Barthes 193). Barthes suggests here that conventional narratives around love seek to subject the lover into a single story. In reality, the act of falling in love may not start at any definitive moment, and heartbreak is rarely a singular, pivotal moment. Love is instead a rather complex interplay of emotions that are reconstructed and reinterpreted over time. In allowing the unstructured arrangement of the figures, readers are invited to acknowledge the chaos of their own emotional journeys. For instance, as a reader seeking to navigate my personal experiences in love, I can select “figures” that resonate with their current emotional states, whether seeking affirmation in ‘The Intractable’ or solace in ‘Agony’. This gives way to a more nuanced understanding of love, one that recognizes the ongoing process of self-discovery and emotional evolution. Finally, references to esteemed figures such as Goethe, Sartre, Baudelaire, and Balzac, alongside anecdotes from personal conversations, are seamlessly interwoven throughout the narrative. This incorporation of external voices lends credibility to the “figures”, which he says are only “established if at least someone can say: ‘That's so true! I recognise that language.’” (Barthes 4). Barthes uses these examples taken from history to exemplify the ideas explored within his text. This portrayal not only validates the “figures” but also underscores the subjective nature of the lover's experience. 
                </p><p>
                    Donna Tartt’s “The Secret History” presents an interesting case study when considering Barthe’s lonely lover. The story follows Richard Pappen, an underprivileged Californian studying in a New England university, who becomes enamored with the students of a charming and mysterious Classics professor, Julian Morrow. Among them are Henry, Francis, Charles, Camilla, and Bunny, whose tragic death is stated from the first page. Unbeknownst to Richard and Bunny, the group engages in a Bacchanal that results in the death of a farmer. When Bunny finds out, the others conspire to silence him, dragging Richard into the midst. With Bunny's death, cracks in the characters' facades are eventually exposed and begin to tear the characters apart. The text infuses themes of classism, the allure of illusion, and the perilous pursuit of external beauty.
                </p><p>
                    Richard, the narrator, shares startling parallels to Young Werther, from whom Barthes used as his main source of reference. Goethe’s “The Sorrows of Young Werther” is a ‘confessional’ novel that chronicles Werther’s obsession with a married woman, who remains oblivious to his affection. His unrequited love is all-consuming and relentless, eventually leading to his suicide. Similarly, Richard writes his story in an almost confessional, personal manner, and would remain in a miserable unrequited love with Camilla till the end. 
                </p><p>
                    We can analyze and understand the problems of Richard’s love of Camilla through Barthes’ figures. In Barthes’ various figures, he depicts the lover’s compulsion to romanticize their beloved that continuously traps him within the throes of intense love. The figure “Adorable!” illustrates in a passage: “After an impression of the night before, I wake up softened by a happy thought: "X was adorable last night." This is the memory of... what? Of what the Greeks called charis: "the sparkle of the eyes, the body's luminous beauty, the radiance of the desirable being"; and I may even add, just as in the ancient charis, the notion-the hope that the loved object will bestow itself upon my desire.” (Barthes 18). Similarly, we find Richard glorifying Camila’s beauty throughout the novel, consistently describing her through light-related metaphors – “light-dazzled eyes” (Tartt 97), “pale and radiant eyes” and “gold glimmer at her temple”  (Tartt 38). He even says at one point that “the mere sight of her sparked an almost infinite range of fantasy, from Greek to Gothic, from vulgar to divine” (Tartt 97). 
                </p><p>
                    Richard’s love remains unwavering despite her rejections and even moments of resentment harbored towards her. Even though it becomes evident that Camilla manipulates Richard at times, as Francis outright tells him, Richard's infatuation persists. This could perhaps be understood through the figure “The Intractable”, wherein love undergoes two affirmations: the initial encounter and a reaffirmation after navigating through doubts and challenges, akin to a "long tunnel." This is a pattern of behavior we see in Richard, who appeared prone to bouts of almost unconscious confessions of love to Camilla in random moments: “...her unconscious and slightly masculine grace of posture; I loved her, loved the luscious, stuttering way she would blink while telling a story”. (Tartt 438) In another scene, even after feeling a "surge of anger” upon seeing her following Charles's hospitalization, he says, “she put down her book - ah lovely, I thought helplessly, I loved her, I loved the very sight of her…” (Tartt 483). These self-affirmations, even after his anger towards Camilla, help perpetuate a cycle of intense, obsessive love, trapping Richard within its grip.
                </p><p>
                    At the same time, Richard as Barthes’ lover also reveals the darker facets of the intense, all-consuming love. The figure “The Tip of the Nose” provides an interesting perspective, as it explores the fragility of the lover’s perception of their beloved and how simple words, actions and factors can easily shatter the illusion of the perfect beloved. Barthes presents this as a violent, disruptive and ugly process, where the lover is “possessed by a demon” (Barthes 28), where disdain now emerges from his mouth and actions, like toads replacing flowers. This transformation represents a moment where the “horror of spoiling” the idealized image of the beloved has overtaken the anxiety of losing them (Barthes 28). When Richard finds out that Camilla had been abused by Charles and was staying with Henry’s help to escape the situation, it is perhaps no coincidence that Richard “felt a fierce, nearly irresistible desire to seize Camilla by her bruised wrist…strangle her, rape her” (Tartt 484). This is perhaps the first and only scene where Richard gets a glimpse into the real motivations behind Camilla, where he realizes she had been touched by other men, making her less of an object to be desired. It is in this moment that the horror of her being spoiled goods made the terrible thoughts arise, revealing the darker underbelly of his desire. 
                </p><p>
                    However, taking a closer reading of the text, one would realize he doesn’t just romanticize Camilla, but also the group of classics students who he desperately wants to belong to. It is apparent from the beginning, where Richard sees them from afar and calls them “an arresting party…to whom they suggested a variety of picturesque and fictive qualities” (Tartt 17). This suggests that maybe Richard’s object of desire is not just Camilla, but a “morbid longing for the picturesque” (Tartt 7). By reconceptualizing Richard's beloved to an obsession for the aesthetic, we can glean deeper insights into Barthes’ argument. 
                </p><p>
                    As with Barthes’ lover, Richard experiences isolation physically and emotionally. When Richard moves to Hampden on his own, he is physically isolated from his family in Plano. Later, when he joins the group of classic students taking classes under Julian, he is virtually isolated from the rest of the campus. As the story evolved further, we find that Richard toes the line between an insider and outsider, never really privy to the happenings of the classics group while simultaneously feeling detached from the rest of the college campus. This is worsened as he is forced to keep the horrific secrets of the murder to himself, unable to turn to anyone. This sense of isolation intensifies as Richard is burdened with the weight of the group's horrific secrets, unable to confide in anyone. The resulting isolation contributes significantly to his descent into alcoholism and anxiety, underscoring Barthes’ assertion that the absence of a coherent language system for love can lead to profound challenges. After all, it is perhaps significant that an epidemic of suicides by young men was sparked by Goethe’s novel who, both visually and attitudinally, emulated Werther (Dashiell). This historical context underscores the profound impact of love on individuals' lives and mental states, highlighting the need for a language for love.
                </p><p>
                    Furthermore, Richard’s obsession with the aesthetic is fraught with suffering, a central theme in the lover’s discourse. The figure "I am engulfed, I succumb" finds the lover bound to become the victim of his own desire. The lover suffers as they cannot escape the pacing, cyclical thoughts of their beloved, but still craves to dissolve entirely into their desires. Richard, like Barthes' lover, is ensnared by his longing for belonging and status among his classmates. His infatuation with the enigmatic characters of Henry and Camila leads him down a path of moral compromise and distress, reflecting Barthes' depiction of the lover's suffering. Through Richard's experiences, we witness the ongoing struggle between despair and fulfillment inherent in love.
                </p><p>
                    In conclusion, Barthes’ portrayal of the lover reveals its complexity, encompassing not only joy but also loss, anger, and dark desires. This candid exploration offers readers insight into the multifaceted nature of love, guiding them in navigating their own experiences.
